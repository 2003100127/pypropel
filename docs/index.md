    # Welcome to the PyPropel documentationðŸš€.

PyPropel provides a Python interface to better pre-processing protein data and post-processing.

* **pre-processing**: interaction sites, protein datasets, protein features, etc.

* **post-processing**: statistics plot, evaluation, protein functional classes, etc.

You only need one line to use PyPropel in Python.

``` py
import pypropel as pp
```
